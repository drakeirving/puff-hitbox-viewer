### FAQ

> What do the different color hitboxes mean?

The different colors represent different hitbox IDs. Eventually the app will have an explanation in it, and without knowing what each hitbox does it doesn't matter anyways, but for the time being just consider that hitboxes are checked in ascending order of Red (ID 0) → Purple (ID 1) → White (ID 2) → Yellow (ID 3); so if a Red and Purple hitbox both connect with something, the Red hitbox is the one that actually hits.

> What are the lines on the hitboxes?

The straight lines show the knockback angle of the hitbox. Hitboxes with a + shape denote the Sakurai angle, which you can read about [here](https://www.ssbwiki.com/Sakurai_angle).
